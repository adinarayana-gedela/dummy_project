    <p class="demo1"><i>Lorem Ipsum</i> is simply <u>dummy text of the printing</u> and typesetting industry. 
        <mark>Lorem Ipsum</mark>mark has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a<span style="color:brown"> galley of type</span> and scrambled 
        it to make a type specimen book
        It has <b>survived</b> not only five <strong>centuries</strong>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
         recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
